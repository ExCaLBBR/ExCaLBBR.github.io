Welcome to the **Ex**perience, **C**onceptual **a**ssociation, **L**anguage, **B**rain and **B**ehavioral **R**epresentation Lab!


The ExCaLBBR lab, managed by Dr. Roberto Vargas at Carnegie Mellon University, aims to understand the how our experiences and social environment influence how we associate and represent conceptual information. Furthermore, our goal is to link graphs (representing a collective set of concept associations) to decisions involving others and decisions to engage with our environment. 

We currently operate as a "subisdiary" of both the [Cognitive Axon Lab (CoAx)](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/cognitiveaxon/) and the [Data Driven Diversity Lab (D3)](https://www.d3lab.org/) at Carnegie Mellon University.
